          <p>My name is Abhishu Mukherjee, and I am a recent graduate of the University of Texas at Austin with a
            Bachelorâ€™s degree in Biology and a minor in Business Administration. I have cultivated an expansive
            knowledge base through my experiences in the medical field. I have worked in various healthcare environments
            including Piga Pediatrics and UT Southwestern Medical Center. While working and volunteering in these
            environments, I developed skills in customer service and databases. I worked with patients and their
            families in order to help them achieve their needs. In addition to customer service, I have experience
            working with databases in which I updated and stored sensitive patient information after being HIPAA
            certified. Throughout college I also worked in Nanomaterials lab and conducted many projects with my team.
            During this experience, I developed strong analytical, problem solving, and technical skills in order to
            conduct our research of the chemical catalysis of nanomaterials. While conducting research, I worked with
            fellow students and lab mentors in order to overcome hurdles and to execute the optimal plan to achieve
            results from said research.</p>
          <p>
            I am currently enrolled in the Full-Time Full Stack Coding Boot Camp at the University of Texas at Austin in
            order to expand upon my technical and coding abilities with the hope of securing a career in technology in
            the future.
